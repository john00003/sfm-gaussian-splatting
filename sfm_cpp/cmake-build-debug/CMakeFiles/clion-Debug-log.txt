CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/github-repos/sfm-gaussian-splatting/sfm_cpp/cmake-build-debug/_deps/imgui-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/github repos/sfm-gaussian-splatting/sfm_cpp/cmake-build-debug/_deps/imgui-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
